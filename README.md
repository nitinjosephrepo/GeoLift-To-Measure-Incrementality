# Why solving Incrementality is Important?
Incrementaility aims to answer one fundemental question, how many of the 1,000 Conversions claimed as driven by Paid Search would have happened 
even if we spent no money on Paid Search? Lift and geo experimentation traditionally have helped us answer that. 

## What is Lift?
Lift is a scientific measurement technique which allows users to accurately understand and compare the value of their strategies. Lift, 
which is grounded on experimental design, is typically used to measure the true or causal effect that an ad campaign had on business metrics such as Sales, App Installs, or Leads. By estimating the incremental effect that these strategies provide, analysts are able to understand, analyze, and optimize their cross-channel strategies through data and science.

## What is Geo Experimentation?

There are many ways to measure Lift and Geo Experimentation is one that has been rapidly gaining popularity. In general, Geo Experimentation 
refers to any test where the treatment is administered at the geo-level. In practice, this often means that ad campaigns are geo-targeted in 
such a way that the test regions are eligible to see ads while the control ones aren’t. Geo Experimental methods use this information to calculate 
the true value that this strategy had on your audience. Moreover, since they rely on aggregated data they’re privacy-safe, can work across channels, 
and are very robust against signal-loss.

## Why GeoLift?

As advertising evolves to incorporate more privacy for consumers, measurement techniques that rely on aggregation and modeling can help you understand true lift. 
That’s because the data used to inform such techniques isn’t affected by changes such as cookie loss. Geo experimentation is one technique that advertisers can use to calculate lift for a variety of channels, even as data availability is reduced or changed across the ads ecosystem.

## Outcome of our GeoLift
The results show that the campaigns led to a 5.4% lift in units sold corresponding to 4667 incremental units for this 15-day test. Moreover, the Average Estimated Treatment Effect is of 155.556 units every day of the test. Most importantly, we observe that these results are statistically significant at a 95% level. In fact, there’s only a 1.1% chance of observing an effect of this magnitude or larger if the actual treatment effect was zero. In other words, it is extremely unlikely that these results are just due to chance.
